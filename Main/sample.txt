Internship Project 1 (Fall 2024)
Initial Kickoff Meeting Report
Topic: Determination of whether a protein source is capable of meeting the regulatory requirements
Group: 09 (ProLabel Pioneers)
1.	Project Details

1.1	Introduction
The Guelph Research Center, a prominent institution in food research, has tasked our team with automating the process of determining whether various protein sources meet the North American regulatory requirements for protein labeling claims. These claims, such as "good source" or "excellent source" of protein, are based on the protein content per serving size according to the Reference Amount Customarily Consumed (RACC). These claims are crucial because they significantly influence consumer choices and purchasing behavior. During our initial discussions with the research center, we learned that there are three key thresholds to determine if a protein product is eligible for a content claim. If the corrected protein content in RACC is:
•	Less than 5 grams: No claim can be made.
•	Between 5-9.9 grams: The product can claim to be a "good source" of protein.
•	10 grams or more: The product can claim to be an "excellent source" of protein.
The challenge lies in automating this process, which typically requires automated extraction of data from research publications (often PDFs), specifically the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS), and then determining the correct labeling claim based on the calculated values. Additionally, the project must ensure that the process accurately extracts or accounts for the RACC value, as the serving size and protein content within that context are essential for determining the correct claim.
1.2	Proposed Methodology to Solve the Challenge
To address the challenge, we will build a web application which will take input from the user and then perform necessary calculations to determine the content claim based on the regulatory requirements. The steps are as follows:
a)	User Input: The website will allow users to specify input data or upload a PDF/Excel file.
b)	Data Extraction: The system will process the input and can extract data from the uploaded PDF/Excel files using Pandas if necessary. Details are in the technology part.
c)	Data Comparison & Calculation: The system will compare extracted data with Canadian and US regulatory reference amounts (RACC). Then it will perform necessary calculations based on provided formulas and determine if the calculated protein content data is in a range to do a content claim (good source, excellent source).
d)	Result Display & Download: Then the system will display results on the web application and will provide an option to download the results as an Excel file.

1.3	Technology Selection and Rationale

a)	HTML: Used for structuring the web application’s content.
b)	CSS: Used for styling the web application to enhance the user interface.
c)	JavaScript: Used for client-side interactions and dynamic functionality.
d)	Python: Used for data extraction and manipulation.
e)	pypdf: Used for basic text extraction from PDFs.
f)	pdfplumber: Specialized in extracting structured data, including complex tables, from PDFs.
g)	pandas: Provides tools for data manipulation, converting structured data into DataFrames, and exporting to Excel.
h)	openpyxl: An engine used by pandas to write Excel files, supporting various features.

o	Position: Research Scientist
o	Email: matthew.nosworthy@agr.gc.ca
o	Role in the Project: Dr. Nosworthy is the primary point of contact for this project. He provided an in-depth overview of the business requirements and clarified essential regulatory details related to protein content claims.
During the kickoff meeting, Dr. Nosworthy outlined the goals of the project, which is to automate the extraction of nutritional data and perform PDCAAS calculations to assess protein content claims in compliance with North American regulations. He also provided clarity on the significance of the RACC (Reference Amount Customarily Consumed) in determining these claims.

3.2	Questions and Answers
Questions our group asked during the initial kickoff meeting and associated answers provided by the business:
•	Question 1: Can you please describe the content claim categories in detail?
Answer: There are three thresholds used to determine whether a product can make a protein content claim:
1.	No Claim: If the corrected protein content in RACC is less than 5 grams, the product cannot make any protein content claim.
2.	Good Source: If the corrected protein content in RACC is between 5 and 9.9 grams, the product can claim to be a "good source" of protein.
3.	Excellent Source: If the corrected protein content in RACC is 10 grams or more, the product can claim to be an "excellent source" of protein.
•	Question 2: Is there any upper limit to the threshold for protein content claims?
Answer: While there isn’t a strict upper limit for the claim, practical limitations exist due to the natural nutritional quality of the food source and the RACC. For example, with a typical serving size of 35 grams, products may not always meet the corrected protein content to make a claim if the serving size significantly increases. The RACC is essential for determining content claims and exceeding the serving size may result in the product not meeting the required protein levels for a claim.
•	Question 3: Do we calculate the claim threshold based on the RACC or the actual amount consumed by the individual?
Answer: The threshold must be calculated based on the RACC value. No matter how much a person consumes, the content claim is based on the standardized RACC for that product. This ensures consistency and fairness across similar products in the marketplace.
•	Question 4: Are there any specific food categories or protein sources we should focus on for the initial setup?
Answer: The focus should remain flexible to cover a range of protein sources, including plant-based and animal-based proteins. However, ensuring accuracy and regulatory compliance for high-protein food products in both categories is critical.
